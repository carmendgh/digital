							Applied is the all-in-one platform for fairer, more predictive hiring. Born out of the UK Government‚Äôs Behavioural Insights Team, the platform is designed with behavioural science at its core to reduce bias and accurately forecast job performance at every step of the process

						While the core debiasing features were in place, the product needed to evolve to compete with other ATS platforms that prioritised speed and efficiency. Creating a fairer hiring process naturally introduced a bit more friction, requiring teams to spend more time reviewing and adjusting. To stay competitive, we had to improve other parts of the experience.

This helped us identify where users needed more support and allowed us to prioritise design efforts based on the most critical pain points and opportunities.
						The insights we gathered pointed to three key focus areas: 

						<br><br> <strong> üé£ Sourcing  </strong> 
						<br> Helping users source larger pools of candidates more quickly, without compromising on quality or fairness.

						<br><br> <strong> ‚öôÔ∏è Viewing & Managing  </strong>

					To support organisations hiring at pace without compromising on fairness, we focused on designing a feature that made better use of the high-quality candidates already assessed through Applied. Many users‚Äîespecially job coordinators‚Äîwere manually tracking near-miss candidates outside the platform, creating GDPR risks and inefficiencies. Our research showed that 85% of users had kept external records of at least one candidate they almost hired.

					<br> <br> We kicked off with an ideation session involving product, design, and engineering leads. This helped us quickly assess feasibility and focus our attention on high-impact ideas. Based on these conversations and our research insights, we positioned the Candidate Pool as a quality-driven feature, allowing users to save standout candidates from the management list as a natural next step in the hiring pipeline.

					To give hiring managers a stronger sense of control and improve team collaboration‚Äîkey focus areas surfaced during research, I designed a centralised Candidate Dashboard.

				Since launch, over 40 clients have started building their talent pools, saving top-scored candidates for future use. Of those, more than 45% have already sourced candidates for new roles using our shortlisting feature. Notably, 25% of clients adopting the feature come from our target sector (tech), and the feature has also helped the sales team re-engage previously dormant deals. We‚Äôve received positive feedback via our impact boards, passed along by both customer success and sales teams, showing strong early traction and ongoing excitement for this capability.

				<div class="lg-col-wrt2"> 
					To reassure organisations that they wouldn‚Äôt lose essential functionality by switching from their existing ATS, we identified job board distribution as a key area to address. By integrating with Broadbean‚Äîa widely used job board aggregator‚Äîwe aimed to both attract new users (particularly from larger organisations) and increase average account value. This integration gave hiring teams the ability to quickly publish roles across multiple job boards, helping them reach a broader, more diverse candidate pool with minimal effort. It also gave users the confidence that their job ads were getting maximum exposure, improving their chances of making successful hires.
