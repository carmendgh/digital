						<div class="lg-col-wrt2"> 
							Lack of job board integrations was a regular sales objection. Many organisations use number of applications as a measure of recruitment team performance, and aim for wide reach at high efficiency. For Applied, we achieve impact by ensuring the right candidates get hired fairly. Wider reach will result in more applications, which in turn increases the probability of the right candidate finding the role.

					<div class="lg-col-wrt2"> The range of job boards offered by Broadbean, a UK-based job board aggregator, is extensive and research concluded that also appealing to our four core markets. Hereâ€™s where our discovery took us:



						<br><br> <strong> ðŸ¤• User Problem: </strong> "I want to introduce Applied at my organisation, but the CFO/COO wonâ€™t sanction the procurement because she is concerned that we arenâ€™t able to post to a range of job boards, which we can with other ATS."
						
						
						
						<br><br> <strong> ðŸ¤ž Outcome: </strong> "Give buyers the confidence that they are not losing functionality from their existing ATS that they perceive as important. Allow the hiring team (platform users) to feel confident they've given their job advert the best chance of success."
						
						
						
						<br><br> <strong> ðŸŽ² Hypothesis: </strong> "We believe that by enabling access to a broad range of job boards via an integration with Broadbean, we can both increase acquisition of new users (particularly larger organisations) and increase the average account value."
						
						
						
						â€“ "Access to job board aggregation via Applied will mean I can quickly and easily attract more candidates across a broader range, saving me time and effort, while improving the likelihood of hiring an outstanding candidate."

				<div class="lg-col-wrt2"> We started our ideation phase by mocking up user flows, validating different assumptions with input from tech and users themselves â€“ internal and externally. We went through some training with Broadbean, to get to understand their product well and how could it seemingly integrate with ours. 



					<br><br> Integration with Broadbean boards was offered to users as an upsell, which meant that we needed to promote it whilst making very clear what it was and how to request access.
