        <h2> A new careers site for B&Q </h2>
        <h5> <br> UX / UI Designer </h5>
          <p> B&Q needed a new careers site that would fully communicated their new Employer Brand and position them as a modern, digital retailer with a dedicated and diverse workforce. It was also important to attract more informed candidates who could effectively self-select, improving this way the volume to quality application ratio.

    <div class="title"> 
      <p>As an additional challenge, we had very limited access to new content such as imagery, due to the site being created during the pandemic. This meant we had to make the most of existing assets, and even integrate user-generated content from employees. </p>

      <h4>Gathering insights</h4>
        <p> We kicked off with a strategy meeting, where we jointly reviewed user surveys and existing website data, and narrowed down the scope of work.

          Based on our research, we found out the following insights:
          - Indeed drove around 70% of B&Q’s traffic in 2019-2020.
          - Brand search was responsible for a further 25% of user engagement. 
          - Over 70% of B&Q’s traffic were landing on an ATS job description.
          
          This data informed the following UX discovery workshops, where we defined needs & obstacles for our personas, mapped out user journeys, and finally, build the information architecture for the site.

      <h4> The Solution </h4>
      <p> We decided to dynamically aggregate content to ensure candidates engage with relevant brand messaging whatever their route to application. Using our own smart careers site technology, <strong> we created a highly personalised user experience that would help candidates discover their own version of Together We Can. </strong>

        We avoided the soul-destroying searching, clicking through irrelevant content and boring job descriptions, and added some slick site design, crafted copy and tons of tailored content that would immerse them in B&Q’s culture.

      <h4> The Results </h4>
      <p> ​​​​​​​On the first month after launch (December 2020), we saw: <br>
* An average session duration on our JD pages of 2mins 38 seconds <br>
* 2000 applications from 7,500 job description visits <br>
* +2000 hours spent by users engaging with the brand <br>
* +2000 video plays <br>

Just after a few months of launching, we won the prestigious <strong> RAD award for best Employer Website 2021 and Employer Brand (National) 2021 </strong> as well as the <strong> Best Careers Website </strong> at the RMAs. Judges praised this website for being eye catching, original and having lots of engagement whilst putting jobs at the heart of the site. A great site that was Easy to use and fun.
